DO NOT use this code, in part or in totality, to cheat, or produce code that would eventually lead to cheat.

# Overview

This application displays the current weapon usage, for Monster Hunter: World.

For those like me who always want to keep en eye on their weapon usage, consider it has an additional UI the game does not provide. Now you can have you weapon usage handy all the time.

The application supports multiple users, and the 3 save slots per account.

The save data is automatically reloaded and the UI is seamlessly updated, so after each auto-save, the application will keep the display up to date.
